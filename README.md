## XPRIZE Carbon Removal Competition

XPRIZE Carbon Removal is a 4 year competition funded by Elon Musk, aimed at tackling the biggest threat facing humanity - fighting climate change and rebalancing Earthâ€™s carbon cycle.

Our team proposea a carbon removal solution which involves capturing CO2 from oceanwater and sequestering them in rocks. Reducing the concentration of CO2 in the ocean would enable atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean, in effect, reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. We are looking into using an electrochemical system (BPMED) to remove dissolved CO2 from oceanwater, and sequester them through mineral carbonation into basalt rocks.
